# PeakViz
This repository represents a simple workflow to visualize Hyperspectral data from point sensors: PSR and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) sensor. The wavelength ranges for these sensors are :
- PSR : 350.0 - 2500.0 nm
- FTIR : 2500.0629 - 15385.6915 nm

# Usage
`pip install peakviz`
